How to jump to the node created with the last capture command?

*** Answer

Jump to boomkark =org-capture-last-stored=, by typing keyboard command C-x r b and then the name of the bookmark.

*** Notes

This is different from C-u C-u C-c C-w, which jumps to bookmark =org-refile-last-stored=.

It is also different from this:

C-u C-c c
Visit the target location of a capture template. You get to select the template in the usual way.  The target location is not necessarily the last location of refile.  The last location may have been at a different date of a date-tree capture, for example.

* Dired
** Changing files by editing the dired buffer

Edit the dired buffer to change file names, move files etc.


*** Answer

C-x C-q (dired-toggle-read-only)

To finish and apply: C-c C-c (wdired-finish-edit)

*** Details
From: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Wdired.html

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
30.17 Editing the Dired Buffer

Wdired is a special mode that allows you to perform file operations by editing the Dired buffer directly (the “W” in “Wdired” stands for “writable”.) To enter Wdired mode, type C-x C-q (dired-toggle-read-only) while in a Dired buffer. Alternatively, use the ‘Immediate / Edit File Names’ menu item.

While in Wdired mode, you can rename files by editing the file names displayed in the Dired buffer. All the ordinary Emacs editing commands, including rectangle operations and query-replace, are available for this. Once you are done editing, type C-c C-c (wdired-finish-edit). This applies your changes and switches back to ordinary Dired mode.

Apart from simply renaming files, you can move a file to another directory by typing in the new file name (either absolute or relative). To mark a file for deletion, delete the entire file name. To change the target of a symbolic link, edit the link target name which appears next to the link name.

The rest of the text in the buffer, such as the file sizes and modification dates, is marked read-only, so you can't edit it. However, if you set wdired-allow-to-change-permissions to t, you can edit the file permissions. For example, you can change ‘-rw-r--r--’ to ‘-rw-rw-rw-’ to make a file world-writable. These changes also take effect when you type C-c C-c.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
C-c / m or C-c \     (org-match-sparse-tree)
Create a sparse tree with all headlines matching a tags/property/TODO search. With a C-u prefix argument, ignore headlines that are not a TODO line. See Matching tags and properties.
C-c a m     (org-tags-view)
Create a global list of tag matches from all agenda files. See Matching tags and properties.
C-c a M     (org-tags-view)
Create a global list of tag matches from all agenda files, but check only TODO items and force checking subitems (see the option org-tags-match-list-sublevels).
These commands all prompt for a match string which allows basic Boolean logic like ‘+boss+urgent-project1’, to find entries with tags ‘boss’ and ‘urgent’, but not ‘project1’, or ‘Kathy|Sally’ to find entries which are tagged, like ‘Kathy’ or ‘Sally’. The full syntax of the search string is rich and allows also matching against TODO keywords, entry levels and properties. For a complete description with many examples, see Matching tags and properties.

There are several repositories: gnu, marmalade, elpa are listed here:
http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ELPA

To use all 3, run this

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq package-archives '(("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
                         ("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/")
                         ("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/")))
#+END_SRC

But how to install packages from them?  See answer:

*** Answer

Run command: list-packages.
Then browse or search for the package you need, and click on its name.  Info is shown in a separate buffer, including a button for installing the package.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
There are some situations, such as before an exam, where you will want to revise all of your cards regardless of when they are next due for review.

To do this, run a cram session with the org-drill-cram command (M-x org-drill-cram RET). This works the same as a normal drill session, except that all items are considered due for review unless you reviewed them within the last 12 hours (you can change the number of hours by customising the variable org-drill-cram-hours).
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq org-drill-cram-hours 0)
#+END_SRC
