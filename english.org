What is the difference between transitive and intransitive verbs?

*** Transitive

It's about something!
Example: I love you! (You is `something` here)

*** Intransitive

It's about nothing Example: I died! (It's about me, I don't need
anything else to make this sentence right)
** Rise, Arise or Raise                                               :drill:

When I should use rise, arise or raise?

*** Rise

Rise is a intransitive verb so I use it to talk about me like:

"I just rose up to have a better view."

Rise: to get higher

Rise is irregullar verb, rose is the past form and risen is the
perfect form

*** Arise

Arise is a intransitive verb, I should use it when something
occurs/happened:

"A few problems arise when I started the project."

Arise: to happen, occur

Arise is also a irregular verb, and works like rise: Arose is the past
form and Arisen is the perfect form.

*** Raise

Raise is a transitive verb, it's about get something higher:

"I raise you to make your view better."

Raise: make higher

Raise is a regullar verb, so I just add `ed` to make it in past:
raised.

"It ain't that good!"

Wow, this sentence is wrong! Why?

*** Why?

Because `ain't` is not a contraction of to be verb, in these case you should use:

"It isn't that good!"

Why that sentence is wrong?

"I seen it before"

*** Answer

Because the locutor is trying to say about something that already
happened, so he must use the Simple Past, and not the broken Past
Participle.

The right ways to say it:

"I saw it before"

Or

"I have seen it before"
